I'd like to clone Wordle since I enjoy playing it. Would be nice to have a version to play anytime. Can expand on the game by selecting a different number of letters each round.

A UI library will be needed for games and Wordle is a simple enough game to only utilize 2D UI elements such as planes. I think a Wordle clone would be a great way to proof out an MVP implementation of a 2D block-ish UI library.

Could also implement a basic memory game. Show player(s) information to repeat once hidden. And also re-order items after having them move around on screen.
