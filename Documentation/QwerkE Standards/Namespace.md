Currently the entire Qwerk framework and engine are using namespace QwerkE. The main purpose is to avoid naming collisions in the future, for user code. Another work around could be to use prefixes like QF_* and QE_* before symbols like functions, classes, types, etc, for Qwerk specific logic. The extra indentation isn't a huge deal, but could be avoided for preference. The prefixes could also relate to the area/module/section/domain of code it lives in, giving some extra information.

## Domains
#TODO Consider removing namespace for prefix QF_\* and QE_\*, and maybe a QC_\* namespace for common files or a new "Common" shared project for all application generic code like utility and helper functions.
