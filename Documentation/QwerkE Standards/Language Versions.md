## C++
QwerkE is currently using C++ version 199711, unless stated otherwise.
That being said, C++17 features like declaring variable inside of if statements will be used throughout the project, so C++17 is considered to be the version used for QwerkE.

The current version of C++ being used by the project exists in the \_\_cplusplus macro, and can be printed using this statement :
```
printf("C++ Version %i", __cplusplus);
```
