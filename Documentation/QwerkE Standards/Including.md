## \#include Ordering
1. System level : \<windows.h\>, \<map\>, etc
2. Libraries : "imgui.h", "glew.h", etc

## Commenting \#includes
#TODO Decide on practice for commenting what an include is for. Maintaining comments should probably be avoided, plus it's more text on screen, and it can be out of date. Probably best to say no and clean up instances already in QwerkE.
Example :
```cpp
#include "file.h" // typeName
```
