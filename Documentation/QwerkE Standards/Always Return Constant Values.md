When returning a value from a function, if the value is believed to be null for a given control flow, like if a pointer holds an invalid address, then a nullptr return is more explicit than returning the pointer itself. Someone looking at the code may or may not determine that the pointer is null on a given line depending on the behaviour of the code, but no one can mistake return nullptr when they see it.
