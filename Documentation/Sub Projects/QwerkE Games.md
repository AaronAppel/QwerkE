Game projects can be used as test cases and proof of concepts for engine features.
By directly using the engine to develop simple games, bugs and other issues can be more easily observed, identified, and investigated.

Changes that break a game project can be reviewed for issues, or the game can be updated to use the newer version of the engine.
The games projects can also serve as tests to see if a new feature works, or if it is truly useful to an example developer.
