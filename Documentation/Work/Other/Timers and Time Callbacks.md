#TODO It might be a cool idea to add a callback feature to the global QF_Time class that tracks timer start requests and does the polling in 1 place, then calls back to the timer to tell it that enough time has passed and it can "expire". An advantage would be polling 1 timer at a time as all timer requests can be ordered by expiry time, and checked only after all sooner timers have expired.

Maybe the syntax gets ugly, or the concept is too foreign or strange for others to use. Still an idea that I'd like to explore further some time.
