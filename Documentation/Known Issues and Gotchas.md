## OpenAL
If soft_oal.dll is not copied to the correct .dll directory with other .dlls like OpenAL32.dll, the calls to al and alc code will return null. You may get useful info from alGetError(), but it can be hard to determine the issue. Make sure the soft_oal.dll is copied correctly to avoid future headaches.
