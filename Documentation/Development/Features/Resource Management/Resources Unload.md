The Resources (Resource Manager) class gives out raw pointers and doesn't guarantee proper disposal of resources on shutdown. At least implement smart pointer references to cleanup memory at shutdown time.

When reference counting is added to the Resources class, add a way to unload all assets not references outside of the Resources class, so all assets with 1 or 0 references can be delete using a public method request.
