It might be nice for a user to load all assets in a level using a data file, or better yet, the engine can parse a level file to find all necessary assets and store them in a list to pass to the resource manager to load and have available when loading the scene. This can also be useful for loading null assets that the framework should use, by creating a manifest in data.  Changing the null asset could be a simple data change if desired for testing, avoiding special logic and hard coding in the engine.
