Time delayed events, or events that trigger based on time.
#TODO Add to the [[Event System]] or event manager so requests can be executed at a later time (from now or a specific time in the future) for convenience and/or performance.

Perhaps a useful use would be quick time or time based in game events.
Another use case could be delaying object deletion during runtime, or spreading out the deletion of objects to minimize framerate decline and "hiccups".
