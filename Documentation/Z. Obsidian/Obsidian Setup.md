For the most part I try to keep markdown files standard, and avoid special Obsidian specific changes. This is to let others conveniently view QwerkE documentation files in their preferred application. That being said, if you'd like to see markdown files similar to me, you can find the lists of **enabled** Obsidian plugins I use below.

*Please keep in mind that these files are symlinked as /H hard links. This is because Obsidian ignores .json files and the source files are inside of the .Obsidian directory. ***DO NOT MODIFY THE LINK FILES**

#### Core Plugins
Can be found in the directory : Documentation\\.obsidian\\plugins
Symlinked from the Obsidian application file : Documentation\\.obsidian\\core-plugins.json
![[Symlinked_core-plugins]]
#### Community Plugins
Symlinked from the Obsidian application file : Documentation\\.obsidian\\community-plugins.json
