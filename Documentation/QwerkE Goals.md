It would be great to accomplish a goal using QwerkE, like releasing a game.
It could be a fun starting goal to make something simple and throw it up on itch.io.
It could act as  a milestone and proof of concept.

Something like a clone, of a tower defence game for example.
There could also be blog posts related to QwerkE development if that's something which would help keep me motivated and producing.
