*WIP*
A simple refactor of the bgfx (https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) project.
I wanted to use bgfx in my existing framework, and wanted to use the example-common project code to startup faster.
Here I just moved code around to avoid dependencies that I didn't want to use.

Full credit to bkaradzic and contributors for making such an awesome graphics library.

Hopefully this can be useful as a new project template in the future.
For more info on how I am using bgfx, see my game engine repo https://github.com/AaronAppel/QwerkE
