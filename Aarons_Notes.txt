Make sure each project builds with PCHs off and no pch.h force include.
This is to allow easy code intergration/extraction. The PCHs are just to speed
up the build and do not introduce a file dependency since all files should
already #include necessary files.
// TODO: Make sure #includes are minimal and require the least amount of
// outside code files
Remember that right now there are platform define issues where files need
<windows.h> included before they work because of platform specific libraries.
This is currently being solved by force #including "Engine_Defines.h",
"Engine_Platform.h".
