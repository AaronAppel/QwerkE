Make sure each project builds with PCHs off and no pch.h force include.
This is to allow easy code intergration/extraction. The PCHs are just to speed
up the build and do not introduce a file dependency since all files should
already #include necessary files.
// TODO: Make sure #includes are minimal and require the least amount of
// outside code files
Remember that right now there are platform define issues where files need
<windows.h> included before they work because of platform specific libraries.
This is currently being solved by force #including "Engine_Defines.h",
"Engine_Platform.h".

How useful would a flie finder program be?
It would take something like "#include "file.h"" and replace it with
"#include "../../Folder/file.h""
Something to think about. It is nice to allow for file movement and auto
#includes but is that just too lazy or too error prone?

Before giving away any code make sure to test #includes.
If a #include has "../../../" then it may have an issue
with projects not located at the same "depth" because the
3 directories up is not referring to the file, but rather
the working directory of the project.

Trying to get rid of additional include directories. Freetype2 is proving
to be rather intrusive and I don't see how to nicely change the folder structure
without altering the source #includes. I will have to check on this later.
Bullet is also dependent on a globally #included root folder.
