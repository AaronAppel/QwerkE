# Qwerk_Engine
### About
I use this project to learn and develop a game engine for hobby.
Ideally the engine can be useful for making my own games, or those who might brave the challenge of using it as well.

The name QwerkE is simply endearing to me as it's a play on the "QWER" keyboard layout, with the later 'E' meaning editor or engine.
