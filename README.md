# Qwerk Engine (QwerkE)
### About
I use this project to develop a simple game engine for hobby.
Ideally QwerkE can be useful for making my own games, and for those who might brave the challenge of using it as well.

The name QwerkE is simply endearing to me as it's a play on the "QWER" keyboard layout, with the later 'E', which stands for Engine or Editor.

\**This project is continually in development and should be considered unstable, until proven otherwise!*
## Getting Started
Run "START HERE.bat" in repo root directory to generate and launch Visual Studio 2022 solution

GitHub : [Getting Started Page](https://github.com/AaronAppel/QwerkE/tree/master/Documentation/0.%20Getting%20Started%20With%20QwerkE)
Local Repo Obsidian : [[Getting Started With QwerkE]]

## Examples  
#TODO Simple example usage of QwerkE, or a "How To Use" section.
Use game projects for examples to reference :
~~~cpp
int main()
{
    cout << "Awaiting Examples..." << endl;
}  
~~~
